## Team policies
### Coordinator (Ahmed)
  Before each team meeting, the coordinator checks with other team members to remind them of when and where they will meet and what they agreed to do. The coordinator keeps everyone on task and makes sure everyone is involved. The coordinator takes notes on what decisions are made, and what tasks are assigned to team members. Think of the coordinator as a team leader.
### Monitor (Danny)
  The monitor ensures that the team is implementing the functionality as agreed upon. The monitor will look at all MRs. Think of the monitor as a representative of the client who hired your development team.
  The checker is in charge of delivering the solution. They ensure test 
### Checker (Yun Chen)
  The checker is in charge of delivering the solution. They ensure test cases are written and complete, make sure the test cases run and pass in GitLab, and that everything is merged before deadlines. The checker also is in charge of ensuring that the rest of the team is following the Coding Standards, including that documentation and tests are being written by the people who implement functions, and that coding style is consistent throughout the codebase.
  The checker is not responsible for fixing inconsistencies themselves, but rather pointing them out in code
  reviews. Think of the checker as a very focused quality assurance specialist.
